# Einbürgerung Test Practice Website

A fun and engaging web application to help users practice for the German citizenship (Einbürgerung) test, built with React and Vite. The app features a simple UI, spaced repetition for effective learning, visual and auditory feedback, and interactive elements to keep users motivated. It includes "Did You Know" sections and deep-dive options for exploring question themes.

## Features
- **Simple UI**: Clean, intuitive interface for seamless navigation.
- **Spaced Repetition**: Reviews questions at increasing intervals to enhance retention.
- **Visual & Auditory Feedback**: Immediate feedback with animations and sounds for correct/incorrect answers.
- **Engaging Experience**: Social engineering techniques (progress tracking, rewards, and gamification) to keep users motivated.
- **Deep-Dive Content**: Additional background info and interesting facts for each question, with a "Learn More" button for in-depth exploration.
